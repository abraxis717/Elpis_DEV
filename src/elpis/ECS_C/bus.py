"""Elpis ECS — deterministic local message envelope, watermark, mailbox.

Sender attribution
------------------
The kernel OWNS sender attribution. Entity-facing code holds an
entity-bound invocation port (``EntityPort``) issued by the trusted host API
``Kernel.entity_port(entity_id)``. The entity-facing call is
``port.propose(receiver_entity_id, payload)`` — it has NO sender parameter.
The trusted local kernel constructs and seals the envelope with the ACTUAL
bound entity ID, taken from the port, never from caller-supplied fields.
(This closes a historical defect in which a caller could select the sender.)

The port is process-local mechanical authority only. It is not a credential
and not cryptographic. The kernel does NOT isolate hostile Python code that
already possesses the trusted Kernel/control object; the guarantee is
API-level attribution for entity-facing code, not same-address-space
adversarial sandboxing.

Envelope
--------
The canonical envelope binds: schema/version, message ID, sender entity ID,
receiver entity ID, per-sender sequence, payload bytes, payload digest, and
the envelope logical clock. There is NO security nonce: for deterministic
the same-process kernel, the per-sender monotonic sequence is sufficient for
uniqueness and replay ordering. The message ID identifies content/context; it
is NOT an authentication token.

Envelope clock semantics (exact)
----------------------------------------
The envelope's ``logical_clock`` is the **commit clock** of the enqueue
event: the pre-transition kernel clock + 1, i.e. exactly the ``logical_clock``
of the committed ``MESSAGE_ENQUEUED`` event. It is NOT the pre-enqueue clock.
The message ID is ``f(sender, sequence, receiver, payload_digest)`` and does
NOT include the clock, so message identity does not depend on the clock; the
envelope clock is a consistency field that replay verifies
(``envelope.logical_clock == event.logical_clock``). This is deterministic,
documented, replayed identically, and tested across restart.

Delivery semantics (limited, exact)
-----------------------------------
* durable enqueue is a recoverable framed append (length-framed record +
  fsync attempt; complete-frame recovery semantics — NOT a syscall-level
  atomic transaction; see persistence.py);
* each committed message has a monotonically scoped per-sender sequence;
* committed processing of a message is at most once;
* replay of committed history reproduces exactly the committed effects;
* transport-level at-least-once / exactly-once is NOT claimed.

Replay defense is a monotonic per-sender sequence watermark, NOT a bounded
sliding set of message IDs.
