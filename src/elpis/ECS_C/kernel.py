"""Elpis ECS — kernel composition root.

The kernel is the trusted local authority. It:
  * owns sender attribution via entity-bound invocation ports (the
    entity-facing API has NO sender parameter; the sender is taken from the
    bound port, never from caller input);
  * performs committed transitions through ONE centralized transition
    boundary (``_commit``) that owns the before/after root computation, the
    logical-clock increment, the durable framed append, and the projection
    install;
  * maintains the in-memory projection of the committed history;
  * exposes deterministic replay and crash recovery;
  * serializes every state transition with one process-local mutation lock
    (same-process concurrent mutation cannot corrupt event ordering).

The kernel is SAME-PROCESS only. There is no cross-process transport
or cross-process authority (UNRESOLVED / DEFERRED).

API boundary
------------
TRUSTED HOST / CONTROL API (called by trusted host code):
  Kernel.open(dir)            -> fresh or recovered kernel
  Kernel.entity_port(entity_id) -> EntityPort   (issues a bound port)
  Kernel.found_entity(label)  -> entity_id
  Kernel.activate(entity_id)
  Kernel.dormant(entity_id)
  Kernel.reactivate(entity_id)
  Kernel.terminate(entity_id)
  Kernel.step()               -> run one deterministic scheduler pass
  Kernel.run_until_quiescent(max_steps)
  Kernel.close()

ENTITY-FACING API (no sender parameter; sender is the bound port's entity):
  EntityPort.propose(receiver_entity_id, payload) -> message_id

READ-ONLY INTROSPECTION (serialized at a transition boundary):
  Kernel.state_root_digest()
  Kernel.events()
  Kernel.topology_projection() -> TopologyProjection
  Kernel.topology_analysis() -> TopologyAnalysis
  Kernel.entity_ids()
  Kernel.mailbox_size(receiver)

Concurrency contract
--------------------
Every state transition (state read through durable append through projection
install) occurs under one process-local ``threading.RLock``. The deterministic
scheduler remains single-threaded. Read-only introspection uses the same lock.

Same-process security nonclaim
------------------------------
The kernel does NOT isolate hostile Python code that already possesses the
trusted Kernel/control object or can arbitrarily introspect its internals.
The guarantee is API-level attribution for entity-facing code, not
same-address-space adversarial sandboxing.
