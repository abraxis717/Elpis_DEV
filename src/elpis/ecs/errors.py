"""Elpis ECS — error hierarchy.

Validation rejection leaves the committed state unchanged. AppendRolledBackError
means the previous file length was restored and fsynced. Other persistence
failures or cancellation may have an indeterminate outcome: the kernel closes,
invalidates ports, and requires recovery. A checkpoint failure does not change
history. Recovery never invents a partially applied transition.
