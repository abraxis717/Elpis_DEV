"""Elpis ECS — entity-bound invocation port (trusted host API).

Sender attribution
------------------
An earlier draft exposed ``Kernel.propose(sender_entity_id, receiver, payload)``,
which let any caller with access to the kernel select an arbitrary ACTIVE
entity ID as the sender. That contradicted the "kernel-owned sender
attribution" claim.

The kernel separates the **trusted host/control API** from the **entity-facing
messaging API**:

* ``Kernel.entity_port(entity_id)`` is the **trusted host API**. It is called
  by trusted host/control code (the same code that found the entity). It
  issues an opaque, process-local :class:`EntityPort` bound to exactly one
  entity ID, exactly one live ``Kernel`` instance, and one kernel epoch.

* ``EntityPort.propose(receiver_entity_id, payload)`` is the **entity-facing
  API**. It has **no sender parameter**. The sender is always the entity the
  port is bound to; it is taken from the bound port, never from caller input.

Authority model (explicit, bounded)
-----------------------------------
The port is **process-local mechanical authority only**. It is a Python
object held in the same address space as the kernel. It is NOT a credential,
NOT a token, and NOT cryptographic. No port token appears in canonical events
and it does not affect deterministic replay.

**Explicit nonclaim:** the kernel does NOT isolate hostile Python code that
already possesses the trusted ``Kernel``/control object or can arbitrarily
introspect its internals. The guarantee is API-level attribution for
entity-facing code, not same-address-space adversarial sandboxing.

Rejection semantics
-------------------
* a port used against a kernel instance other than its issuer is rejected
  (``PortKernelMismatchError``);
* a port issued by a previous kernel epoch (after ``close()``/``open()``) is
  rejected (``StalePortError``);
* a port whose bound entity is not ACTIVE at send time is rejected
  (``TerminatedEntityError``);
* the receiver remains an explicit parameter and is validated as before.
